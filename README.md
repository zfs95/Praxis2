## Praxis2

Single-page website for a medical practice, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Supports German and Romanian languages with client-side translation logic.  
Hosted directly on GitHub Pages.

### Development notes

Current development work is limited to the following files:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `translation.js`

All structural and content-related changes should be made in `index.html`.  
Additional features or styling adjustments should be implemented by extending the existing files rather than introducing new ones.
